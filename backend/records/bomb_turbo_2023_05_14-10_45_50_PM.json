I would start by opening the middle box (box #50), and if it is not the one with the bomb, I would eliminate half of the boxes (either boxes #1-49 or boxes #51-100) and repeat the process with the remaining boxes. This way, I could ensure that I eliminate as many boxes as possible while minimizing my risk of hitting the bomb. \n\nSo, my choice would be to open [1] box initially, which would be the middle box #50, to start my binary search strategy."

If the first box you open is neither the box with the bomb nor an adjacent box, you can then eliminate half of the remaining boxes and repeat the process until you find the box with the bomb. \n\nWith this strategy, if the bomb is in boxes #1-50, it would take a maximum of 7 moves to find it, and if it is in boxes #51-100, it would take a maximum of 6 moves.

However, we can use probability theory to calculate the expected value of opening different numbers of boxes.\n\nIf we assume that the probability of the bomb being in any given box is 1/100, then the expected value of opening k boxes is:\n\nE(k) = k * (99/100)^k\n\nWe can calculate this value for different values of k to see which number of boxes gives us the highest expected value:\n\nE(0) = 0\nE(10) \u2248 4.35\nE(20) \u2248 7.27\nE(30) \u2248 8.84\nE(40) \u2248 9.50\nE(50) \u2248 9.65\nE(60) \u2248 9.28\nE(70) \u2248 8.39\nE(80) \u2248 6.79\nE(90) \u2248 4.15\nE(100) \u2248 0\n\nBased on these calculations, it looks like the expected value is maximized when we open around 50 boxes.

If the first box you open is neither the box with the bomb nor an adjacent box, you can then eliminate half of the remaining boxes and repeat the process until you find the box with the bomb. \n\nWith this strategy, if the bomb is in boxes #1-50, it would take a maximum of 7 moves to find it, and if it is in boxes #51-100, it would take a maximum of 6 moves.
